'''So this is function
1st we write def which active function mean definr function in python
next we write name of function
next in () we write variables 
next we write our code 
after code we use name of function in next code insted of using complete code again and again and 
variable values can be changed each type by writing function name and in () we will replace
value of variables in () each time according to our desire it will act smae with our code '''
