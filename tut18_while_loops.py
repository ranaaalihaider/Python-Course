''' Now we will study while loop1
we will declare variable first'''
i =0
while(i<51):
    print(i)
    i=i+1

'''So This code will check variable i now while has coondition until i is less than 50 print i and plus 1 on every return'''
#now we will use while loop in input
print("Enter Number under 51")
s=0
while(s<51):
    s=int(input())
    print(s)
print("Number is greater than 50")
'''So we declared variable
next we said check s is less than 51 as 1st value was 0 it step forward to input section
now it will take input if inut is less than 50 it will print and will again take input if value is greater it will exit loop'''


#Now we will creat decrimenting while loop to decrease in number
