    '''So this is loop in python in this we can make any string or tupple to run loop on it
after far we will declare variable for our loop next after in we will declare our tupple or string we created or a 
range that we can creat in for loop command
in next line print (variable name) will print each part of string sepracted by comma or each letter of word or from range 
each number in range'''

'''So in this command 3rd thing in range tells the gap between numbers'''
